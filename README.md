# Grade-Calculator_GUI
This is my *work- in-progress (not anymore; read the "about" section to see what more I may be doing!) grade calculator converted to a GUI format using the Tkinter framework. The features that are associated with this application are:
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Range

This application also includes an intuitive interface where all you have to do is click on a button and see what happens!  There are also images and sound effects to make it more interactive and interesting.

Update: you don't need to do the above anymore.  For Windows, go into the .zip file and create a shortcut of the .exe (make sure you turn off Windows Defender or it'll read it as a virus).  Then, as long as you keep all of the other directories ("SFX/", "IMG/"), the program will look just fine.  I'll be updating this to include a method for GNU/Linux.

Update #2: since the excutable was too big on Linux, you have to decompress the "Grade_Calculator_GUI" for GNU/Linux devices.  Then, you open the directory in the terminal and, considering that (most) all GNU/Linux have Python already installed, then you specifically state in the terminal "python Grade_Calculator_GUI.py" in order to run the software.  If you don't have Python, you can get it here: https://www.python.org/.  

Update #3: To see the releases for each platform, go to the "Releases" section and you can pick the specific version for the platform.

This is my first large-scale GUI project, so it may be a bit unpolished (I know Tkinter looks a bit outdated).

Hey, testing with git, wowo!  See if this works!
