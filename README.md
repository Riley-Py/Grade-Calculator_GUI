# Grade-Calculator_GUI
This is my *work- in-progress (not anymore!) grade calculator converted to a GUI format using the Tkinter framework. The features that are associated with this application are:
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Range

This application also includes an intuitive interface where all you have to do is click on a button and see what happens!  There are also images and sound effects to make it more interactive and interesting.
To install:
1. Install Python: https://www.python.org/ (if you are on Linux, you can skip since (mostly) all Linux distros have Python pre-installed)
2. From the "Grade_Calculator_Repository" download the directory (doesn't matter where you install it; merely keep the container directory)
3. In the folder, look for the "Grade_Calculator_GUI.py" and double-click on it
4. Volia! The program should be running and you should be able to use it!

Alternatively, if you don't want to install Python (which I know many people that don't), simply install the executable file outside of the "Grade Calculator_GUI" and run it from there.
This is my first large-scale GUI project, so it may be a bit unpolished (I know Tkinter looks a bit outdated).
